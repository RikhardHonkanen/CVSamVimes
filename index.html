                        My name is Samuel Vimes, I'm originally from Cockbill Street, Ankh-Morpork. I've served for most of my life in the City Watch, most recently as its Commander.

                        These days I am, sadly, mostly kept busy with other duties as the Duke of Ankh. When I get some spare time I like to breed dragons and, of course, spending time with my dear wife Sybil and my son, young Sam.
